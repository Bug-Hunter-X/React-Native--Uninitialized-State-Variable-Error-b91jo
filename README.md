# React Native Uninitialized State Variable Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: accessing a state variable before it's been initialized.  This often happens when dealing with asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, which attempts to render data from a state variable before the data has been fetched.  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a solution using the optional chaining operator and a conditional render to handle the case where the state variable is still undefined. 

## Solution

The solution uses conditional rendering and optional chaining. This ensures that the component doesn't crash if the state variable is undefined, improving the overall robustness of the application.  Always handle asynchronous operations correctly in React Native to avoid this common issue.
