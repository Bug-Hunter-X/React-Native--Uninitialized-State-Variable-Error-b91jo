This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This is a common issue in React Native, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations.  For example, if you fetch data from an API and try to render it before the fetch is complete, you'll encounter this error. It often manifests as a `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'this.state.myVariable')` error.
